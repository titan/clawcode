"""DeepSeek OpenAI-compatible adapter.

DeepSeek exposes an OpenAI-shaped Chat Completions API but:
- Enabling thinking for `deepseek-chat` requires sending `thinking` via OpenAI SDK
  `extra_body`.
- In thinking + tool-call loops, clients must return `reasoning_content` in
  subsequent requests to allow the model to continue its chain-of-thought;
  otherwise the API may return 400 per vendor docs.
